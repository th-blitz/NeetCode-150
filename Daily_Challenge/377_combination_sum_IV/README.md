### Medium - https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/

Given an array of distinct integers ``` nums ``` and a target integer ``` target ```, return the number 
of possible combinations that add up to ``` target ```.<br />

### Example 1. 

``` 
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

```
### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 200
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- All the elements of nums are unique.
- 1 <= target <= 1000
